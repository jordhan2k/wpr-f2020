        <p>5 STUDY TIPS DURING COVID-19</p>
    </div>

        <div class="tips">Stay Organized</div>
        <div class="tip-content">Every year, so many things are changing in the courses of engineering colleges in India. There are some things (study tips) that helps you to keep track of for each class including the in-person parts of this course, the methods of accessing labs
            and lectures, changes in assignments, changing the assignment submission, offered quizzes or exams virtually, etc.</div>

        <div class="tips">Avoiding multitasking</div>
        <div class="tip-content">Doing work on your own and your time is less structured, you might be more tempted to multitask. Students of best engineering colleges in Rajasthan think that they can do multiple things at once. But research shows us that only about 2% of the
            population can perform multitasking. Even if you feel like doing multi-tasking, it is also known as micro-tasking.
            <br> The biggest disadvantage of multitasking is that the assignments take longer time. Each time you come back to an assignment, you must be familiar with it. You are more likely to make mistakes. When your brain is divided into different
            activities at a time, you are less likely to commit the learning for long-term memory. Instead, students of private engineering colleges in Rajasthan must focus on one thing at a time, take breaks between tasks, and follow the “pomodoro method”
            that help you focus for 25- or 50-minute periods and then enjoy rewards with 5- or 10-minute breaks.</div>

        <div class="tips">Making the most of video lectures</div>
        <div class="tip-content">Stick to the schedule of your instructor. It will help your normalcy and prevent you from falling way behind. Find out the method of asking questions, close distracting tabs and apps. Most of the humans are not as good at multitasking as they
            think. Students of top engineering colleges in Jaipur must watch recordings at normal speed. A research has been conducted which shows that playback speed of 1.5x can lower your retention and can result in lower scores on assessments. Faster
            playback speeds are worse for complex, and multi-step material. So it is one of the best study tips for engineering students.</div>

        <div class="tips">Setting a schedule</div>
        <div class="tip-content">Students of BTech Colleges India will have fewer social commitments, group meetings, or possibly, work hours. Setting a schedule for yourself can help provide structure and keep candidates motivated. This template can help an individual to organize
            your time if you do not already keep a weekly or daily calendar. Also, include time for exercise and self-care.</div>

    <div class="parallax gray" id="para-5">
        <div class="tips">Working with a group or team</div>
        <div class="tip-content">Remote collaboration will look a little different, but it is definitely possible for an individual. Try not to procrastinate. That group project may be out-of-sight, out-of-mind if students of best engineering colleges in Jaipur are not seeing
            each other regularly. Resist the urge to put it off. Make small progress and stay in touch. Meet regularly, especially if an individual touches base during class or lab. An individual must consider a quick text on your group chat about progress
            every couple of days. Ideally, having real conversations over video any week help you to work together. Check out tools you have access to as students.
